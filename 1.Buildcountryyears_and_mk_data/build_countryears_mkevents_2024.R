#note: start and end years refer to when the data should start for the purposes of making the country-year grid. This is important because 
#it makes it so that countries that become independent after 1945 only enter the data at that time. 
#We need to also keep "entry year" because that is the year of independence - NB

# As previously, update Germany and Yemen:
# Gleditsch data had two countries called "Germany".
# The one that continues through was given cow code 255, 
# which is considered modern day Germany. The one that ends in 1990
# was given code 260.  This appears to be wrong; east Germany/GDR ought to be 265.
# In the new data, 260 is used for GFR (West Germany) and unified Germany.
# So I will start with the new data and: (i) change "German Federal Republic" 
# to be "Germany", and change it to 255 to match COW. I will rename
# GDR as "Germany (east)" and leave it with ccode 265.

# and getting data on it for its few months of existence
# would be tricky or impossible. So I'm recoding this event

# 4. Important documentation ====

# Overall approach: Use Gleditsch as a starting point for countries and their years,
# then resolve discrepancies. Mostly I resolve disagreements towards the legacy
# countries and years. The disagreements get revealed through the code,
# and should be revisited. This includes differences between start and end years w
# here the "new" (Gleditsch) and "legacy" (sftg -> pitf > ushmm) frames disagree.
# For now we are just using legacy start and end years except where this
# creates a problem (like missing an onset) or we've otherwise chosen otherwise.
# (e.g. Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka; see below).
# You can view the "disagreements" data frame to see these discrepancies.

# If a country ends after 2017, it's ending is not covered by
# Gleditsch, and so we are assuming it goes until the max year.
# Will have to make exceptions by hand if they occur.

# For present purposes, I'm coding only Tanzania (510), not
# Zanzibar (511), because we don't have Zanzibar (511).
# It also does not have an ISO code. As Ben noted, it was
# during a brief moment of independence that the killing
# occurred. Nevertheless, adding Zanzibar as its own country
# and getting data on it for its few months of existence
# would be tricky or impossible. So I'm recoding this event
# to Tanzania. We could, if we want, remove it from Tanzania's
# "ever responsible" record, but I will leave it for now.

# Serbia:
# (1) Ben's original notes say to code the location as 340, inherited by 347.
# Responsibility stays with 340.
# (2) Gleditsch has 347 and calls it Kosovo (2008-onward). Gleditsch
# also has two Serbias with 340, one pre-WWI, and one starting again in
# 2006.
# (3) In our old data framework, we don't have a 340.We have a 345 named
# Serbia (2006 to present) with sftgcode=SRB; another 345 named Serbia
# but with an sftgcode of YGS for 1945-2005, and 347 for Kosovo (347)
# for 2008 onward. So effectively we have one country, called 345, which
# is YGS then SRB, and separately a Kosovo 2008 onward.
# The structure we have might not be a bad fit, though I'm concerned
# about calling Serbia and Yugoslavia by the same CCODE --
# we need to check what data this really draws in from the sources we use.
# Serbia is the largest of the new constitute countries in former YGS but
# not by a lot.
# The decision was made to have Serbia inherit responsibility (so, 345 currently)
# whereas the location, though originally in 345 for the onset, is inherited
# by Kosovo (357 as we have it).This led to a choice to exclude "mk_location"
# (the location of the onset) from the location inheritance as a general rule.
# We could revisit this. It is mainly an issue in former Yugoslovia but
# also a few other places where mk_location and mk_location_inheritance1 don't match.

# Germany:
# Old data had two countries called "Germany".
# The one that continues through was given cow code 255,
# which is considered modern day Germany. The one that ends in 1990
# was given code 260. This appears to be wrong; east Germany/GDR ought to be 265.
# In the new data, 260 is used for GFR (West Germany) and unified Germany.
# So use the Gleditsch coding as a starting point bu then:
# (i) change "German Federal Republic" to be "Germany"
# and change its ccode from 260 to 255.
# (ii) rename GDR to "Germany (east)" and leave it with ccode 265.

# Yemen
# In the old data there is one country running through with cow code 679,
# which is similar to how V-Dem handles it. COW codes also exist though for
# three Yemens -- essentially a north, south, and modern. We return to this 
# here, and it is a good match to Ben's coding.

# Sri Lanka: independence moved up to 1948, fitting Gleditsch,
# and counting an event otherwise missed.

# Zimbabwe (Rhodesia): independence moved up to 1965, fitting Gleditsch,
# and counting an event otherwise missed.

# This emphasizes the need to revisit all discrepancies
# in independence timing between our legacy data and
# Gleditsch... problems were mainly caught when there
# was an MK but there is no telling how many of the other
# disagreements might be problematic.
#
# If you go by cow code, the following appear to be present in Gleditsch but
# missing from the legacy set: Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Serbia, Iceland,
# Cape Verde, Zanzibar, Tibet, Brunei.
# Some of these (Bahamas, Belize, Brunei) are getting close to 500k, but not yet.
# We will have to keep an eye on these.
# Zanzibar and Tibet we do not consider independent (see note above re: Zanzibar).
# Cape Verde passed 500k in about 2007 so we added for 2024 update.
# Serbia -- see above -- it is not missing but has different COW code.

# Note also that"mk_location" (the cow code where the onset is coded to occur)
# is NOT included as the "location inheritance" code, though it is often the same
# since including it would ensure the event is inherited by the country where
# it "occurred" even if the part of the country that experienced it broke off.

# We also muted "responsible_inheritor_2" as per discussion by email.

## 4.2. Variables included and needed: ====
# Checking what we need for model:
# NB: location_ever {0,1}: has the state experienced a mass killing within its territory since 1945?
# CJH: yes, now called mk_location_ever

# NB: responsible_ever {0,1}: has the state been responsible for a mass killing since 1945?
# CJH: yes, now called mk_responsible_ever

# NB: widetargeting {0,1}: 1 if the state has one or more ongoing mass killings that target multiple groups. This can include both state and nonstate led mass killings.
# CJH: yes, called widetargeting

# NB: narrowtargeting {0,1}: 1 if the state has one or more ongoing mass killings that target one group. This can include both state and nonstate led mass killings.
# CJH: yes, narrowtargeting

# NB: anymk.ongoing {0,1}: 1 if any state or nonstate led mk is ongoing in that year
# CJH: mk_ongoing. There is also a counter of ongoings, mk_ongoing_counter.   
# NB: anymk_onset {0,1}# CJH: mk_onset; there is also mk_onset_counter, which counts how many MKs onset in a given country year (which is occasionally 2 or even 3).
